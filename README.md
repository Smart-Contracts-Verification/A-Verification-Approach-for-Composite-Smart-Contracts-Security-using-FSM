# Verification-Approach-for-Solidity-based-Smart-Contracts-using-FSM
![tool architecture1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79995136/150977983-4125557b-ead5-418e-940a-01ea44a59607.png)
In this work, we consider both the correctness verification  and the vulnerabilities detection by applying formal verification in order to detect the mistakes, which makes smart contracts more secure. The approach is based on  the finite state machine (FSM) to model the smart contracts behaviors and the defined security properties that should be verified. 
For this, we take vulnerabilities logic to extract the FSM-vulnerability and translate it into temporal logic CTL formulas (Computation tree logic). These FSM-vulnerabilities will become a specifications predefined in our approach. And the functional properties are user-defined. Finally, we use the nuXmv symbolic model checker to verify the model against specifications. This approach is validated using different set of solidity SCs.
